EDA on a diabetes dataset and predictions using ML methods

Some info on the case study

Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.
Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the square root of n_samples (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).
